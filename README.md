## Introduction
This is an analysis on electrical vehicles registered in the state of Washington released by (data.wa.gov}

After cleaning privacy data such as DOL id and VIN number that are not necessary, I imported the dataset into Jupyter notebook and begun analysis.

## Questions
> 1. How many electric vehicles are registered compared to tradtional petroleum vehicles?
> 2. In the state of Washington, which county has the highest number of registered EV?
> 3. How much has EV been growing since 2017?

## Analysis

The first plot I made was to show the percentage of EV market share on the total number of new vhicles registered

To my surprise, EV has less than 1% of the whole newly registered vehicles from 2017 to 2022. I assumed this would be higher considering the growing popularity of green and renewable energy. And the fact that almost all major car manufacturing companies have released a EV model, albeit pure EV or hybrid. 

This could be due to the price difference between EV and non-EV. Whenever people think of EV, Tesla is the brand that comes to mind, and Tesla gained a general concensus of being a luxury car suitable for mid-higher social class. Therefore, car buyers would still more likely to stick to tradional gasoline cars with a wider range of price. 

Second, I explored the EV owner distribution within Washington State.
